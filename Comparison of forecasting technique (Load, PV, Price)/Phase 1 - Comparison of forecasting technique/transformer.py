"""## **Positional encoding**

Since this model doesn't contain any recurrence or convolution, positional encoding is added to give the model some information about the relative position of the words in the sentence. 

The positional encoding vector is added to the embedding vector. Embeddings represent a token in a d-dimensional space where tokens with similar meaning will be closer to each other. But the embeddings do not encode the relative position of words in a sentence. So after adding the positional encoding, words will be closer to each other based on the *similarity of their meaning and their position in the sentence*, in the d-dimensional space.

See the notebook on [positional encoding](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/community/en/position_encoding.ipynb) to learn more about it. The formula for calculating the positional encoding is as follows:

$$\Large{PE_{(pos, 2i)} = sin(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})} $$
$$\Large{PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = cos(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})} $$
"""

  return tf.cast(pos_encoding, dtype=tf.float32)

"""## **Masking**

In the time series forecasting setting in our case studies, there is no need for the two masks. The reason is as follows:
 

1.   padding mask - since there is no embedding layer creating the tokens of words, the padding mask is not needed
2.   look-ahead mask - the the decoder input is a sequence of known load (t(-24) to t(-1)) that is ahead of the current prediction sequence (t(0) to t(24))and thus, there is also no need for the look-ahead mask.

Mask all the pad tokens in the batch of sequence. It ensures that the model does not treat padding as the input. The mask indicates where pad value `0` is present: it outputs a `1` at those locations, and a `0` otherwise.

  # add extra dimensions to add the padding
  # to the attention logits.

"""The look-ahead mask is used to mask the future tokens in a sequence. In other words, the mask indicates which entries should not be used.

This means that to predict the third word, only the first and second word will be used. Similarly to predict the fourth word, only the first, second and the third word will be used and so on.

"""## **Scaled dot product attention**

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/scaled_attention.png" width="500" alt="scaled_dot_product_attention">

The attention function used by the transformer takes three inputs: Q (query), K (key), V (value). The equation used to calculate the attention weights is:

$$\Large{Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax_k(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}) V} $$

The dot-product attention is scaled by a factor of square root of the depth. This is done because for large values of depth, the dot product grows large in magnitude pushing the softmax function where it has small gradients resulting in a very hard softmax. 

For example, consider that `Q` and `K` have a mean of 0 and variance of 1. Their matrix multiplication will have a mean of 0 and variance of `dk`. Hence, *square root of `dk`* is used for scaling (and not any other number) because the matmul of `Q` and `K` should have a mean of 0 and variance of 1, and you get a gentler softmax.

The mask is multiplied with -1e9 (close to negative infinity). This is done because the mask is summed with the scaled matrix multiplication of Q and K and is applied immediately before a softmax. The goal is to zero out these cells, and large negative inputs to softmax are near zero in the output.

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/multi_head_attention.png" width="500" alt="multi-head attention">


Multi-head attention consists of four parts:
*    Linear layers and split into heads.
*    Scaled dot-product attention.
*    Concatenation of heads.
*    Final linear layer.

Each multi-head attention block gets three inputs; Q (query), K (key), V (value). These are put through linear (Dense) layers and split up into multiple heads. 

The `scaled_dot_product_attention` defined above is applied to each head (broadcasted for efficiency). An appropriate mask must be used in the attention step.  The attention output for each head is then concatenated (using `tf.transpose`, and `tf.reshape`) and put through a final `Dense` layer.

Instead of one single attention head, Q, K, and V are split into multiple heads because it allows the model to jointly attend to information at different positions from different representational spaces. After the split each head has a reduced dimensionality, so the total computation cost is the same as a single head attention with full dimensionality.

The transformer model follows the same general pattern as a standard [sequence to sequence with attention model](nmt_with_attention.ipynb). 

* The input sentence is passed through `N` encoder layers that generates an output for each word/token in the sequence.
* The decoder attends on the encoder's output and its own input (self-attention) to predict the next word.

### **Encoder layer**

Each encoder layer consists of sublayers:

1.   Multi-head attention (with padding mask) 
2.    Point wise feed forward networks. 

Each of these sublayers has a residual connection around it followed by a layer normalization. Residual connections help in avoiding the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.

The output of each sublayer is `LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))`. The normalization is done on the `d_model` (last) axis. There are N encoder layers in the transformer.
